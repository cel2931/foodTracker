# foodTracker

## Description

`foodTracker` is a Swift project that was created to practice 3D touch handling and the swift syntax itself. 

This app main aim is to provide the user with an option to store his/hers favorite meals, so:
- It allows loading an image per meal, from the phone library.
- A rating option is available for every meal introduced.
- It helps to keep track of the restaurant location by long tapping in the map view.
- It is also possible to get rid of old meals from the list view, either by editing the table or using 3D touch on the meal 
cell.

There are also shortcuts available from the app icon to navigate straight to:
- The new meal addition view.
- Check the meals already included in the user list.
- Edit the first meal on the list.
